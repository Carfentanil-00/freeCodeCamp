      <p id="d-crime">The pricing of crime scenes depends on the on the size of the cleanup. However our flat rate is $600 an hour and can go up to near $1000 an hour depending on the severity of the situation. Crime ain't cheap! That being said, there is a victim benefits program from the government that usually helps with the costs if their is no homeowner/business insurance</p>
